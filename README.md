# Java OOP: Triangle Validation & Peer Mentor Eligibility

## Overview
This project demonstrates Java OOP concepts, decision statements, and boolean logic through two programs:
1. **Peer Mentor Eligibility Checker**: An interactive console application that determines eligibility for a Peer Mentor position based on user responses to a series of questions.
2. **Triangle Class Enhancements**: Extends the `Triangle` class to include methods that check if a triangle is equilateral or a right-angle triangle, considering floating-point precision.

## Features
- **Boolean Logic and Decision Making**: Implements decision statements to guide user interactions and validate conditions.
- **Enhanced Triangle Class**: Adds methods to identify equilateral and right triangles, with precision handling for floating-point comparisons.
- **Driver Programs**: `TriangleTest` and the peer mentor checker test each component, providing user-friendly output.

## Usage
1. Compile and run the peer mentor eligibility checker to answer questions and check eligibility.
2. Compile `Triangle.java` and `TriangleTest.java` to validate triangle properties.

## Documentation
Generate Javadoc comments for `Triangle.java` to ensure all methods are documented.

## Project Files
